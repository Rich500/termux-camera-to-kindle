# termux-camera-to-kindle.sh

Inspired by [Antony Cairns](https://www.bjp-online.com/2018/05/cairnstateshape/). This short script was a tiny side project during my COVID restricted masters in photography. With no access to a darkroom I experimented with obscure/misunderstood digital technologies for image-making. 

The aim is to demonstrate e-ink technology as a medium for reproduction and the act of repurposing a commercial artefact for unconventional means (in this case appropriating monochrome images -the more indeterminate and abstract the better). 

The Bash script is callable within termux, with the API installed. It takes a photo from the android phone and, over wifi, transfers it to the kindle and displays it. 

It requires jail broken kindle (I used a kindle 4NT) and root access.
